# Project Scope Document: Script Translation Feature

## Project Overview

TunedIn aims to enhance its personalized audio briefing service by adding a new feature that translates scripts from English to a user-specified language. This feature will expand the accessibility and reach of TunedIn's content to a more diverse audience.

## Project Requirements

1. **Frontend Interface**:
   - A web interface to allow users to input a script in English and select the desired language for translation.
   - Start a flask app that servers a home page
   - Home page should have input box, language drop down and go button

2. **Backend API**:
   - A new API endpoint `/translate_script` that handles the translation requests.
   - Handle go button and take request to backedn
   - input verification

3. **Translation Service Integration**:
   - Integration with a reliable translation service, such as Google Cloud Translation API, to perform the actual translation.

4. **Database (Optional)**:
   - Store user preferences, translation history, and metadata for analytics and future use.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Proper error handling to manage and respond to various scenarios like missing input, service errors, etc.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging and monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new feature.

## Milestones and Checkpoints

  - Ensure that all changes are tracked separately.

### Milestone 2: Frontend Development

- **Checkpoint 2.1**: Design the web interface
  - Create an HTML form to input the English script and select the desired language.

- **Checkpoint 2.2**: Implement form submission
  - Use JavaScript to handle form submission and display results.

- **Checkpoint 2.3**: Test the frontend
  - Ensure the form is functional and can handle various inputs.

### Milestone 3: Backend API Development

- **Checkpoint 3.1**: Set up the Flask application
  - Initialize a new Flask project and configure basic settings.

- **Checkpoint 3.2**: Implement the `/translate_script` endpoint
  - Create the API route to handle translation requests.

- **Checkpoint 3.3**: Integrate with the translation service
  - Configure and integrate with Google Cloud Translation API.

- **Checkpoint 3.4**: Implement error handling
  - Ensure the API responds appropriately to various error scenarios.

### Milestone 4: Database Integration (Optional)

- **Checkpoint 4.1**: Set up Firestore (or chosen database)
  - Initialize the database and configure connection settings.

- **Checkpoint 4.2**: Implement data storage
  - Create functions to store translation history and user preferences.

- **Checkpoint 4.3**: Test database interactions
  - Ensure data is correctly stored and retrieved.

### Milestone 5: Logging and Monitoring

- **Checkpoint 5.1**: Implement logging
  - Set up logging to track API usage and errors.

- **Checkpoint 5.2**: Set up monitoring (optional)
  - Configure monitoring tools to keep track of the feature's performance.

### Milestone 6: Testing and Validation

- **Checkpoint 6.1**: Perform unit testing
  - Write tests for individual components and functions.

- **Checkpoint 6.2**: Conduct integration testing
  - Ensure all parts of the project work seamlessly together.

- **Checkpoint 6.3**: User acceptance testing
  - Gather feedback from potential users and make necessary adjustments.

### Milestone 7: Documentation and Handoff

- **Checkpoint 7.1**: Create user documentation
  - Provide detailed instructions on how to use the new feature.

- **Checkpoint 7.2**: Technical documentation
  - Document the code, API endpoints, and any integration steps.

- **Checkpoint 7.3**: Handoff and training
  - Ensure the intern is familiar with all aspects of the project and can hand off the work to the main team.
